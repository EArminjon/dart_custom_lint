## About

Lint rules are a powerful way to improve the maintainability of a project.
The more, the merrier!
But while Dart offers a wide variety of lint rules by default, it cannot
reasonably include every possible lint. For example, Dart does not
include lints related to third-party packages.

Custom_lint fixes that by allowing package authors to write custom lint rules.

Custom_lint is similar to [analyzer_plugin], but goes deeper by trying to
provide a better developer experience.

That includes:

- A command-line to obtain the list of lints in your CI
  without having to write a command line yourself.
- A simplified project setup:
  No need to deal with the `analyzer` server or error handling. Custom_lint
  takes care of that for you, so that you can focus on writing lints.
- Debugger support.
  Inspect your lints using the Dart debugger and place breakpoints.
- Supports hot-reload/hot-restart:
  Updating the source code of a linter plugin will dynamically restart it,
  without having to restart your IDE/analyzer server.
- Built-in support for `// ignore:` and `// ignore_for_file:`.
- Built-in testing mechanism using `// expect_lint`. See [Testing your plugins using expect_lint](#testing-your-plugins-using-expect_lint)
- Support for `print(...)` and exceptions:
  If your plugin somehow throws or print debug messages, custom_lint
  will generate a log file with the messages/errors.
